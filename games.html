      <h1>Games Development</h1>
    </header>
    <p>Arguably the most important skill required by games programmers is problem solving - being able to break a problem down into pieces and coming up with a solution. This applies to all aspects, from implementing new gameplay features to finding and fixing bugs. Skilled developers can show logical and abstract thinking, being able to take systems apart and understand how all the pieces fit together. They also need to be able to solve problems quickly and elegantly, which requires a wide selection of tools, as well as knowledge of techniques for solving recurring problems.</p>
